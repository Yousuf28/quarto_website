*A complete guide with examples, time customization, and process management*

Sometimes you need to automate a task on a Linux server — but **crontab isn't available**. This is common on restricted systems, containers, or environments where cron is not installed or disabled.

With a simple Bash loop, you can create your own lightweight scheduler that behaves similarly to cron.

This guide covers:

* How to build a Bash-based scheduler
* How to change the schedule time and day
* Example scripts
* Directory structure
* How to start, stop, and restart the scheduler
* Logging
* Notes about server timezone differences


> **Note:**
> The **Linux server time may be different from your local timezone**. Always verify the server time with:
>
> ```bash
> date
> ```
>
> Adjust the scheduled time accordingly.


### Directory Structure

```
your-project/
│
├── master.sh
├── run_schedule.sh
└── scheduler.log        # created after first run
```


### Example Task Script (`master.sh`)

This script is what you want to run on schedule.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "Master script executed at $(date)" >> master.log
```


### The Scheduler Script (`run_schedule.sh`)

This script continuously checks the date and time.
It runs `master.sh` every **Saturday at 06:00**.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

SCRIPT="./master.sh"

while true; do
    DOW=$(date +%u)      # Day of week (1–7, Monday=1)
    TIME=$(date +%H:%M)  # Time in 24-hour format (HH:MM)

    if [[ "$DOW" == "6" && "$TIME" == "06:00" ]]; then
        echo "Running master.sh at $(date)"
        bash "$SCRIPT"
        sleep 60  # Prevent running twice in the same minute
    fi

    sleep 20
done
```


# How to Change the Schedule (DOW & TIME)

The scheduler uses two conditions:

* **DOW** → Day of week
* **TIME** → Exact time (HH:MM)


### Changing the Day of the Week (DOW)

The command `date +%u` returns:

| Value | Day       |
| ----- | --------- |
| 1     | Monday    |
| 2     | Tuesday   |
| 3     | Wednesday |
| 4     | Thursday  |
| 5     | Friday    |
| 6     | Saturday  |
| 7     | Sunday    |

#### Examples

**Run every Monday at 06:00:**

```bash
if [[ "$DOW" == "1" && "$TIME" == "06:00" ]]; then
```

**Run every Wednesday at 06:00:**

```bash
if [[ "$DOW" == "3" && "$TIME" == "06:00" ]]; then
```

**Run every Sunday at 06:00:**

```bash
if [[ "$DOW" == "7" && "$TIME" == "06:00" ]]; then
```


### Changing the Time (TIME)

Time is checked using:

```bash
TIME=$(date +%H:%M)
```

This is 24-hour format.

#### Examples

**Run at 07:30 AM:**

```bash
if [[ "$TIME" == "07:30" ]]; then
```

**Run at 11:45 PM (23:45):**

```bash
if [[ "$TIME" == "23:45" ]]; then
```

**Run at midnight:**

```bash
if [[ "$TIME" == "00:00" ]]; then
```


### Running Twice in a Day

Example: Run at 06:00 and 18:00 on Saturday:

```bash
if [[ "$DOW" == "6" && ( "$TIME" == "06:00" || "$TIME" == "18:00" ) ]]; then
```


### Running Every Day at a Specific Time

Remove the DOW check:

```bash
if [[ "$TIME" == "06:00" ]]; then
```


### Running Every Hour at HH:00

```bash
if [[ "$(date +%M)" == "00" ]]; then
```


# Running the Scheduler in Background

Give execute permissions:

```bash
chmod +x master.sh
chmod +x run_schedule.sh
```

Start it using `nohup` so it survives logout:

```bash
nohup ./run_schedule.sh > scheduler.log 2>&1 &
```


# Checking If the Scheduler Is Running

```bash
pgrep -fl run_schedule.sh
```

Or:

```bash
ps aux | grep run_schedule.sh
```


# Stopping (Killing) the Scheduler

Kill by name:

```bash
pkill -f run_schedule.sh
```

Or kill by process ID:

```bash
ps aux | grep run_schedule.sh
kill <PID>
```

Force kill:

```bash
kill -9 <PID>
```


# Restarting the Scheduler

```bash
pkill -f run_schedule.sh
nohup ./run_schedule.sh > scheduler.log 2>&1 &
```


# Viewing Logs

```bash
tail -f scheduler.log
```


# Final Thoughts

This method lets you schedule tasks without relying on cron.
By adjusting the `DOW` and `TIME` variables, you can create almost any schedule you want — daily tasks, weekly tasks, specific hours, or multiple run times.
