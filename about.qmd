I am a programmer with a Ph.D. in Pharmaceutical Sciences. My background
combines pharmaceutical research with advanced computational and data science
skills. My expertise spans multiple programming languages including R, Python,
SQL, and Bash, along with modern development workflows such as Git, GitHub,
CI/CD, AWS.  I specialize in CDISC SEND data standards for nonclinical
toxicology studies, computational toxicology, statistical analysis, and machine
learning.  I have experience developing R packages, building interactive R shiny
web applications, and creating data pipelines for regulatory science
applications.  I work at the intersection of pharmaceutical sciences, data
science, and software development, applying computational approaches to solve
complex problems in biomedical and life science fields.
